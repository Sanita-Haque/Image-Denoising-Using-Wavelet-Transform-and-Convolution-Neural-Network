# Image-Denoising-Using-Wavelet-Transform-and-Convolution-Neural-Network

In the field of image processing, image naturally corrupted by noise is a common problem. Images are corrupted by various types of noises. In this project, gaussian, speckle, and Poisson noises are considered. For noise removal, I have used wavelet transform and convolutional neural networks. The typical discrete wavelet transform's wavelet coefficients are threshold by the wavelet de-noising technique. On the other hand, the convolutional neural network in image denoising has some importance. It has different layers that can use corrupt data as input and output units to enforce the data set to have a better representation of feature data. The performance is measured by PSNR.
